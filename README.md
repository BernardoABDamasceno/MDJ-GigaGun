# MDJ-GigaGun
MDJ Game Project

## Suggestions:
 - level up gets random gun
 - physics need refining, particularly the jump, felt off
 - gun feel a bit off still
 - assembly mode still feels pretty place holder, mby something like resident evil or backpack hero for assembly
 - look up arcade or bullet hell games also for reference for guns and power ups

 - Terminal velocity way too low, and it goes too quick to it losing gun downwards velocity way too fast
 - RPGs need to spawn a bit further a way from the player to not clip into vision.

## Known Bugs:
# (order of importance from up to down)

 - some objects make the player start stutter walking

 - parameterizar tudo como deve de ser

 - grenades sometimes pass thru ground (requires checking in new map)

 - flamethrower particles too narrow and short
 - explosion particles too small

 - Hard-reset of assembly camera on first click

 - connection points iluminam-se uns aos outros com colisoes(? i dont know what this means)

(who cares at this point, unless we figure out if replicable)
 - bug where the flamethower flames were blue for a second after firing when first clicking into the game (once on startup)
 - got a bug with the flame thrower once where it took like half a second to change directions when walking, haven't been able to replicate it
