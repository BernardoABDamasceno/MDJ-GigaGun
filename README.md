# MDJ-GigaGun
MDJ Game Project

## Suggestions:
 - level up gets random gun
 - physics need refining, particularly the jump, felt off
 - gun feel a bit off still
 - assembly mode still feels pretty place holder, mby something like resident evil or backpack hero for assembly
 - look up arcade or bullet hell games also for reference for guns and power ups

## Known Bugs:
 - pause menu in assembly mode lets player drag camera
 - when in assembly mode if return to menu through pause menu when starting game again player is stuck until going back to assembly mode
