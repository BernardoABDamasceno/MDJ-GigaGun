# MDJ-GigaGun
MDJ Game Project

## Suggestions:
 - level up gets random gun
 - physics need refining, particularly the jump, felt off
 - gun feel a bit off still
 - assembly mode still feels pretty place holder, mby something like resident evil or backpack hero for assembly
 - look up arcade or bullet hell games also for reference for guns and power ups

## Known Bugs:
 - got a bug with the flame thrower once where it took like half a second to change directions when walking, haven't been able to replicate it
 - shotgun doesnt hit
 - flamethrower particles too narrow and short
 - explosion particles too small
 - flamethrower stops death animation 
 - bug where the flamethower flames were blue for a second after firing when first clicking into the game (once on startup)
