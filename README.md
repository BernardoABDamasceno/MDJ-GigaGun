# MDJ-GigaGun
MDJ Game Project

 - level up gets random gun
 - physics need refining, particularly the jump, felt off
 - gun feel a bit off still
 - look at quake 3, doom, unreal for reference
 - more gun variety
 - assembly mode still feels pretty place holder, mby something like resident evil or backpack hero for assembly
 - map change
 - possibly remove camera recoil
 - look up arcade or bullet hell games also for reference for guns and power ups
 - fix desynchronization between recoil and upgrade screen
