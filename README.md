# MDJ-GigaGun
MDJ Game Project

## Suggestions:
 - level up gets random gun
 - physics need refining, particularly the jump, felt off
 - gun feel a bit off still
 - assembly mode still feels pretty place holder, mby something like resident evil or backpack hero for assembly
 - look up arcade or bullet hell games also for reference for guns and power ups

## Important for MOJO:
# (order of importance from up to down)

 - some objects make  the player start stutter walking (BUG) (new update makes it less likely but its still there)
 
 - parameterizar tudo como deve de ser (REVIEW)
 
 - Hard-reset of assembly camera on first click (BUG)
 
 - maybe add a limiter (terminal velocity) to pushback so the player can't go to fast to the point it traverses the map boundaries (REVIEW)

 - connection points iluminam-se uns aos outros com colisoes(? i dont know what this means - Bernie) (DON'T KNOW - Gon√ßalo)

(who cares at this point, unless we figure out if replicable)
 - bug where the flamethower flames were blue for a second after firing when first clicking into the game (once on startup) <- isto acontece quando faz load pela primeira vez, logo n se deve repetir

 - got a bug with the flame thrower once where it took like half a second to change directions when walking, haven't been able to replicate it
