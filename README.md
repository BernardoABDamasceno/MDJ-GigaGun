# MDJ-GigaGun
MDJ Game Project

## Suggestions:
 - level up gets random gun
 - physics need refining, particularly the jump, felt off
 - gun feel a bit off still
 - assembly mode still feels pretty place holder, mby something like resident evil or backpack hero for assembly
 - look up arcade or bullet hell games also for reference for guns and power ups

## Known Bugs:
 - when paused if firing a gun:
   - Plasma orbs still spawn
   - pushback is accumulated, when unpaused player flies away
 - animations for shooting are being run in each individual update functions
 - got a bug with the flame thrower once where it took like half a second to change directions when walking, haven't been able to replicate it
